/*12. Merge Sort on Doubly Linked List
Given Pointer/Reference to the head of a doubly linked list of N nodes, the task is to Sort the
given doubly linked list using Merge Sort in both non-decreasing and non-increasing order.
Example 1:
Input:
N = 8
value[] = {7,3,5,2,6,4,1,8}
Output:
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
Explanation: After sorting the given linked list in both ways, the resultant matrix will be as given
in the first two lines of output, where the first line is the output for non-decreasing order and next
line is for non - increasing order.*/
